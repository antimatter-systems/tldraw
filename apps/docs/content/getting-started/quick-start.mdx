<h2>Add a tldraw canvas to your React app in just 5 minutes.</h2>

The tldraw SDK provides a really simple way to craft infinite canvas experiences for the web. It's perfect for collaborative applications, productivity tools, interfacing with multi-modal AI, and more.

By the end of this guide you will have made something that looks like this: 

<Embed className="article__embed--quickstart" src="https://vite-template-five.vercel.app/" />


Follow the steps below to make your own version of it, or [clone the repo](https://github.com/tldraw/vite-template) to skip to the end.

    ### Installation

    - Set up a React project however you normally do. [We recommend Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).
    - Install the tldraw library using this command:
    
    ```bash
    npm install @tldraw/tldraw@beta
    ```
  </li>
  <li>
    ### Import Styles
    <br />
    To import fonts and CSS for tldraw:

    - Create or edit a css file called `index.css`
    - Copy and paste this into the file:
    ```CSS
    @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;700&family=Roboto+Mono:wght@400;700&display=swap");
    @import url("@tldraw/tldraw/tldraw.css");

    body {
      font-family: "Inter";
    }
    ```
  </li>
  <li>
    ### Render Tldraw Component
    <br />
    To render the Tldraw component

    - Import the `<Tldraw />` component from `@tldraw/tldraw`
    - Import the `index.css` CSS file from earlier
    - Wrap the Tldraw component in a `<div>` element with the style attribute set to: `{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }`
    
    <p className="">This will render a full screen canvas:</p>

    ```javascript
    import { Tldraw } from "@tldraw/tldraw";
    import "./index.css";

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
          <Tldraw />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
  </li>
</ol>

### Next Steps

You did it! Now that you have your canvas working, you may be wondering: what next? You can try: 

- Giving the editor a makeover by [customizing the UI](/docs/user-interface)
- Adding your own [shapes](/docs/shapes) and [tools](/docs/tools)
- Providing collaboration using [multiplayer](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw-yjs-example) 

We provide the above examples and more in our [examples section](/examples/basic/develop). Go build something creative and please do share it with us in our [#show-and-tell](https://discord.com/invite/SBBEVCA4PG) channel on Discord!
